# MERG_FILES

This C++ code will merg many files in a single file.

INSTALLATION:: "cd /MERG_FILE", "chmod a+x configure" and ./configure.

After installation you will have a linux utility named "mergfile"

>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>USER MANUAL<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<
first of all you should creat a directory ~/Desktop/PARTS. move all text files to be merged in to this directory
and when you prompt "mergfile" in command line , it will ask you for full path of the directory where files are present
and another question for directory. Supply the answer and your files will be merged. That merged file can be found in a directory ~/Desktop/MERGED. This programme will creat automatically the directory MERGED. No worry.
It also will show you very brief manual in prompt.
If you don't want make it as linux utility, you can use "mrg.cpp", a C++ code file.
